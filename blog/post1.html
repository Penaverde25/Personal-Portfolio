    <h1>Esports Player: My Valorant Journey</h1>
    <p><em>Published on May 15, 2025</em></p>
    <p>
      My journey in Valorant started in 2022 when I joined my first online tournament on Discord and met random players. I was a rookie on that team, and of course, it did not go well. Later, I tried out for the CCS Warriors Valorant team, and my team and I were accepted. We joined the CPU CCS Warriors team and proudly represented the CCS department of our school, CPU. After that, we won and became champions in 2022. We also won again in 2023, representing the CCS Warriors Valorant team.
